                   --------------------------------------
                     Released as freeware in May 1997.

     The letters of this font are a plumber's nightmare of
     criss-crossing pipes. Pipe-Dream has only the uppercase alphabet,
     numbers and basic punctuation.

     You may use Pipe-Dream without payment, but you may not sell this
     font or distribute a modified version without my written consent.
     Pipe-Dream may not be distributed without this text file.

     To avoid loss of quality, please do not convert this font to other 
     formats without checking with me first. Pipe-Dream is currently 
     available in four formats (PostScript and TrueType for both 
     Macintosh and Windows) and has been tested in all four formats.
